This is intended to be a collection of tools that can be sed in the design of retrofit interventions for indidvidual homes, please note these are developed by others but shared here together save others time.

# Environmental tools

* [Energy performance certificates](https://find-energy-certificate.digital.communities.gov.uk/find-a-certificate/search-by-postcode)
 
 _Search for an energy performance certificate for an indivodual home here_

* [Domestic energy model](https://sap2012.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 
 _This open access version of SAP 2012, based on the BREDEM methodology, has been created and shared by Steven Firth and Ben Hall, Loughborough University. This can be used to model poetntial improvements in energy performance from fabric, heat and power interventions to the home, but may require additional support in using_

* [Domestic energy model guidance](https://www.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/SAP/2012/SAP-2012_9-92.pdf)

 _This is open material shared by the UK Government on SAP 2012_

* [Embodied carbon database](https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon-footprint-database.html)

 _This is openly shared by Circular Ecology, as embodied carbon is not yet Goverened in the UK the data is not shared centrally_

* [Meet regulations](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200135/approved_documents/74/part_l_-_conservation_of_fuel_and_power/2)
 
 _This is Part L Conservation of fuel and power for existing buildings, shared by UK Government_
 
 * [Conservation areas](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/has/conservation-areas/)
 _This is the UK guidance on conservation areas, find out if your home is in a local conservation area via your local authority Planning team_
 
# Economical tools

To estimate savings in fuel bills the domestic energy model above can be used

* [House price increases as a result of energy improvements](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-saving-measures-boost-house-prices)
_This website summarises a UK Government report of house price increases following energy improvements_

* To find out if invividual intervetnions could be cheaper to maintain than at present, check out manufacturers information, or potentially speak to the installer for insight on this

# Social tools

To estbalish whether there are any environmental conditions that could be improved, a walk through the house with a sketched floor plan, or a conversation regarding this is recommended, perhaps focusing on:

* Thermal comfort (any cold areas, draughts, does the home lose heat quickly?)

* Acoustics (any problems with noise ingress, or noisy appliances in the homee?)

* Air quality (any damp problems, or a lack of ventilation, especially when cooking or producing steam in the home?)

* Aesthetics (anything to improve, to adapt the home in line with householder preferences?)

 _This information can form the basis of post-occupancy evaluation from the householder perspective, used to compare pre and post retrofit_

* Legislation compliance (check with building control if anything in the building regulations above is unclear)
