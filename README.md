# Retrofit-co-design-toolkit

Welcome!

This is a toolkit that can be adopted for individual dwelling retrofit design. 
I hope this can assist pool tools for designers, householders and practitioners, as well as researchers.

I welcome suggestions of how this can be improved.

As a new user of Github, this is an experiment to explroe whether tools can be shared and progressed quicker, when shared in Github.

Please contact me here or via kate.simpson@imperial.ac.uk if you would like to discuss this work.
